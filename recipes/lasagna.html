        <h2>A finished dish of lasagna</h2>
        <p>Zucchini lasagna is a modern twist on regular lasagna! 
            It’s made with layers of baked zucchini instead of pasta noodles. 
            Between each layer are all the classics of regular lasagna that we know and love – a cheesy ricotta filling, fresh basil, and rich marinara!</p>
        <p>It’s low-carb yet decadent and cheesy! I am so sure you and your family will love this recipe.</p>

        <h2>Steps to making a Zucchini lasagna</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Use a mandoline slicer or a chef’s knife to cut the zucchini into thin, noodle-like slices about 1/8 inch thick. A mandoline slicer is the easiest and most precise tool—just set it to 1/8 inch and always use the guard for safety. If you don’t have one, you can carefully use a chef’s knife by slicing off the ends, standing the zucchini upright, and slowly cutting even slices. Be cautious and patient, especially if you’re less experienced with knife skills.</li>
            <li>Salt the zucchini. In order to remove excess moisture, you have to salt the zucchini. Arrange the noodles on paper towels and lightly salt them, then let them sit for 10 minutes. Pat them dry when finished and wipe off the salt.</li>
            <li>Pre-bake the zucchini noodles. The next step to ensure the noodles are soft and not watery, is to bake them. Place the noodles on trays lined with parchment paper and bake for 10 minutes at 375F. Then pat dry when they’re removed from the oven.</li>
            <li>Mix the ricotta filling. In a small to medium-sized bowl, mix together the ricotta, parmesan cheese, garlic, fresh basil, egg, and pinch of salt & black pepper.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna. Next, in a 13×9 baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara, and a layer of zucchini noodles.</li>
            <li>Add the ricotta and herbs. Next, spread a thin layer of ricotta and sprinkle the chopped basil and oregano over top.</li>
            <li>Top with cheese and repeat. Next, add a layer of mozzarella and a little parmesan cheese. Then repeat until finished with sauce, zucchini noodles, ricotta, herbs, and cheese.</li>
            <li>Final layer and bake. Top the last layer of the lasagna with mozzarella and parmesan. Bake uncovered at 375F for 40-45 minutes, broil on HIGH for 1 minute for the cheese to brown. Then slice and serve!</li>
        </ol>
